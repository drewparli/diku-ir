# Zipf's Law and Heaps' Law

Both `zipf.py` and `heaps.py` use the raw text data in `karamazov.txt` to demonstrate Zipf's law and Heaps' law, respectively.

The raw text in `karamazov.txt` is adapted from The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky from the Gutenberg Project (see 
`https://www.gutenberg.org/files/28054/28054-0.txt`). Additionally, the string "BBBBB" has been inserted at the start of each chapter to make it easier to divide the text into chapters.
